Objective :

We want to have a database that stores all the data on available grocery 
items, like the category of food items, their prices, discounts and offers 
available. We will store the customer and seller’s (who sells the ordered goods 
from his warehouse) data. We will store the quantity of available items 
presently available in the seller’s stock. With every user sign up we generate a 
unique customer id or seller id which refers to that particular user.
From this database, we will be able to analyze frequently ordered items or 
categories for a particular user. Order of every customer will be recorded and 
can be shown in his/her order history. Customers can also see his/her shopping 
cart.

DA-MART offers various groceries, discountable offers, coupons, etc. 
Groceries include categories of daily essentials like beverages, dairy products, 
bakery products, fruits, vegetables, frozen items, edible oil, grains, spices, dry 
fruits, etc with their respective category id. If a customer orders above a 
certain amount then he/she can get coupons or vouchers. We can state the 
estimated delivery time for an order in the database. We would store the 
user’s data like customer id, delivery address, contact details, email-id, etc. 
Wishlist and ordered items can be stored in the customer’s profile. Items will 
have item code, item name, item category, price, rating, average purchase 
price, stock, expiry date, and seller id.

lower bound price in a specific category on the DA-MART database. Vouchers 
will include vouchers and their types. Orders will include a unique order id and 
its order date with its customerid. Order details will also be stored, including 
the code of the item, ordered quantity, and rate(price per unit of an item sold). 
Wishlist will contain the wishlist id and customerid. Wishlist details will include 
the wishlist id and item code. The shopping cart will include the cart id,
